# Training_Center_Project
This is a really simple PHP x MySQL CRUD web application implements in less than 2 days. UI is not really implemented, the point of this project is to manipulate database through PHP and MySQL and output to the browser for authenticated users. 

# Dependencies 
## MAMP
Or any other server you prefer. 
If you use MAMP, you will need to clone this repository and put it in the `htdocs` folder in your MAMP directory, and then direct to `localhost` in your preferred browser to run the application. 

## MySQLWorkBench 
Demo database is available in the folder `Demo Database`. You can see the schema and can run the SQL script(`training_center.sql`) in your MySQLWorkBench to have the demo database set up.

There is also triggers and functions written in the script to ensure data integrity.
